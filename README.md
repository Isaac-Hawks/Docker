# Jellyfin Docker Container
This is a template for a jellyfin server that runs in a docker container
These instructions are tailored for Ubuntu/Debian

## Download:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Isaac-Hawks/jellyfin && 
cd jellyfin
```
## Setup/Deployment
For this to work, you need docker + docker-compose on the device that will be hosting your Jellyfin server

If you do not already have these installed. run this command:
```bash
sudo apt-update && sudo apt-get install docker.io docker-compose -y

```
After you have docker installed, you have to start the container in the jellyfin directory:
` sudo docker-compose up -d `
Note: If this is your first time doing this, docker will need to download the jellyfin image.

## Container Management
* If you ever want to edit the docker-compose.yml file, run `docker-compose down` from inside the jellyfin directory to remove the container and network,
  then run `docker-compose up -d` to rebuild the container and network
* To temporarily stop the docker container so it doesn't hog all your resources, run `docker stop jellyfin`
  * To start the container again, run `docker start jellyfin`



## Accessing your server
If you are accessing your server from your host machine, then you will need to navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8096.  
Otherwise, if you are accessing your server from a different device, go to http://server-ip:8096
* To find your server ip address, run `hostname -I | awk '{print $1}'` on the machine hosting your Jellyfin server

# Folder Structure:
```
/jellyfin
  ├── /cache
  │   └── .gitkeep
  ├── /config
  │   └── .gitkeep
  ├── /media
  │   └── README.md
  ├── docker-compose.yml
  └── README.md
```
## Note:
When you clone this repository, the cache and config folders will be empty.  
Once you finish the setup process on the webpage, jellyfin will automatically keep that information in the config directory.  
When you scan a library for the first time, Jellyfin will pull metadata from sources like TVDB/TMDB and drops it into the cache folder.
